Mr. Samuel wish the website like :
1. theme for background is pastel or bright colors
2. layout and font make it simple but look aesthetic
3. having an engaging introduction on the front page
4. user can checkout without account
5. product not display full when user click, just small detail
6. operation after checkout continued outside application

follow-up interview with some question to get deep meaning about the requirements
1. what is the purpose of pastel or bright color?
-> I think a website with pastel colors can appear friendly to users, and this contrast between the products and the website can be visually appealing
2. Why do you want the website to allow users to checkout orders without requiring an account?
->  want to simplify the process for users who just want to buy clothes, making it faster for them
3. What do you mean by 'checkout continued outside the application,' and how does it work?
-> I mean that after users validate their orders, the communication between them and the admin can continue through platforms like WhatsApp or email, allowing them to chat for further assistance.

from the interview Mr. Samuel want the website really like :
1. The website is designed to be simple, allowing users to easily select and purchase items. Afterward, order tracking continues through app communication methods such as email or WhatsApp
2. Using pastel colors and displaying small details upon user clicks, Mr. Samuel wants the website to have a friendly appearance with subtle interactions or animations
